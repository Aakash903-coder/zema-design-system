<h3>Context over consistency</h3>
Consistency and standards are important for building a unified design language and help the user know what to expect from our product and how to use it. However, this does not mean sacrificing the user experience. In this sense, the context and needs of our users are priorities when developing our solutions.

<div>
<h3>Usable</h3>
Users and their needs drive our design process. For us, being usable means being built with empathy, reaching users' real needs and problems by putting ourselves in their shoes and looking at their world with attention and care. To achieve these results, we carry out research, analyze data and always listen to it.
</div>

<div>
<h3>Inclusive</h3>
We design our experiences for real people. We understand that those who use our products have different conditions and abilities. This understanding guides us in developing more humane solutions.
</div>


<div>
<h3>Direct</h3>
All elements must have a purpose. These elements must provide experiences that allow people to achieve their goals quickly, efficiently and as directly as possible.
</div>


<div>
<h3>Autonomy through empowerment</h3>
We believe in the potential of people and their ability to develop the best solutions. In this way, we empower teams to feel confident when designing solutions, knowing that they will do so by ensuring the best user experience, while working on what they are passionate about doing.
